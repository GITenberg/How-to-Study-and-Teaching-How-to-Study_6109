description: '"Some seven or eight years ago the question of how to teach children
  to study happened to be included in a list of topics that I hastily prepared for
  discussion with one of my classes. On my later examination of this problem I was
  much surprised, both at its difficulty and scope, and also at the extent to which
  it had been neglected by teachers. Ever since that time the two questions, How adults
  should study, and How children should be taught to study, have together been my
  chief hobby. The following ideas are partly the result of reading; but since there
  is a meager quantity of literature bearing on this general theme, they are largely
  the result of observation, experiment, and discussion with my students. Many of
  the latter will recognize their own contributions in these pages, for I have endeavored
  to preserve and use every good suggestion that came from them; and I am glad to
  acknowledge here my indebtedness to them"--Preface. (PsycINFO Database Record (c)
